Trump = tb('''In a new book detailing the wild first year of Donald Trump's presidency, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is quoted blasting top operatives in the 2016 campaign for their naivete and idiocy in their dealings with the Russians.

He's absolutely right.Of the July 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr., Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and several Russians -- in which dirt on Hillary Clinton had been promised to the campaign -- Bannon tells author Michael Wolff, according to the Guardian, which obtained an early copy of the book:
"The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor -- with no lawyers. They didn't have any lawyers. Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad s***, and I happen to think it's all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately."
Correct!
The idea that a meeting between the three top officials in the Trump campaign and a handful of people with Russian ties could or should be held in Trump Tower is, on its face, ludicrous. And, that doesn't even get into the fact that the reason (or a reason) that the meeting even happened in the first place was that Don Jr. had been promised dirt on Clinton by Rob Goldstone, a publicist for Russian pop star Emin Alagarov, whose father is a business tycoon close to the Russian government.

Whether or not anything actually happened -- Don Jr. insists the meeting was brief and uneventful -- the sheer appearance that such a gathering conveys is a very bad one. Particularly when you consider that two former Trump aides have already pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about their contacts with Russia during the 2016 campaign.
According to the Guardian:
"Bannon went on, Wolff writes, to say that if any such meeting had to take place, it should have been set up 'in a Holiday Inn in Manchester, New Hampshire, with your lawyers who meet with these people'. Any information, he said, could then be 'dump[ed] ... down to Breitbart or something like that, or maybe some other more legitimate publication.' You never see it, you never know it, because you don't need to ... But that's the brain trust that they had."
This is what is known as plausible deniability. As in, senior leadership in any campaign never get too close to the truly explosive (or potentially explosive) material that is peddled in the dark channels of opposition research so that -- if ever it actually blows up -- they can honestly say they never knew about it.

What Bannon nails in the last line of his quote above is the fact that the "brain trust" of the Trump campaign simply wasn't terribly well versed in the ways that modern campaigns operate. Don Jr. and Kushner are family; neither man had ever been involved in politics at any sort of national level prior to this campaign. Manafort hadn't run -- or really been involved at a high level with -- a campaign in this country in decades.
These were not, in short, the best of the best. Why? Because no one thought Trump had a shot in hell of winning. And, even when it became clear by the spring of 2016 that he actually might win -- that's when Manafort signed on -- no one who had run a previous campaign at the national level in the last decade was willing to touch the radioactive Trump.
How Trump has disparaged the Russia investigation
How Trump has disparaged the Russia investigation
There were undoubtedly benefits to the lack of knowledge Trump and his inner circle had about the way things were done in campaigns. They ran a different campaign because they didn't know what a normal campaign looked like.
But, this Trump Tower meeting is the other side of that coin. It was a colossally bad decision -- even if nothing at all happened in it.
Say what you will about Steve Bannon -- and you can say a lot -- but he gets that. And he gets -- better than anyone in the White House apparently does -- what is headed their way.
"They're sitting on a beach trying to stop a Category Five," he told Wolff.''')
Bannon = tb("""President Donald Trump excoriated his former chief strategist Steve Bannon in a statement Wednesday, claiming that Bannon "lost his mind" after being pushed out from the White House.

The White House released the strongly worded 266-word statement from the President slamming Bannon after excerpts from a new book quoted Bannon as calling the meeting between a Russian lawyer and the President's eldest son, son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort "treasonous" and "unpatriotic."
"Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind. Steve was a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination by defeating 17 candidates, often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the Republican party," Trump said in the statement.

Bannon: 2016 Trump Tower meeting was 'treasonous'
Bannon did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment.
Trump's fiery statement marked the most significant rebuke by the President of his former chief strategist, who since leaving the White House has maintained an influential position as an informal adviser to Trump and a de-facto leader of the President's populist movement.
"Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn't as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country," Trump said.
Trump also accused Bannon, who has called the mainstream media the "opposition party," of being too cozy with reporters and spending much of his time inside the White House leaking "false information."
Once influential
Bannon only joined Trump's campaign in an official capacity in August 2016. But the Breitbart News chairman became one of the most influential forces inside Trump's hectic campaign during the most critical periods of Trump's battle with Hillary Clinton for the presidency. He and Trump bonded over their shared instinct for bare-knuckle politics and similar outlook on the core issues of Trump's campaign, such as trade and immigration.
In his six months inside the White House, Bannon was one of the President's most influential advisers, leading the charge for Trump to keep some of the most far-reaching and radical campaign promises and reminding Trump of the expectations of his political base.
He was pushed out of the White House amid retired Gen. John Kelly's house-cleaning upon taking over as chief of staff in the summer. But he retained an influential position as one of the coterie of informal advisers the President regularly speaks with by phone, often to the dismay of some of the President's top advisers who have clashed with Bannon.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed Wednesday that Trump and Bannon spoke as recently as last month -- even as she backed up Trump's claim that Bannon "lost his mind" after he exited the White House in August.
Even more powerful?
Steve Bannon comments on Roy Moore accusations.
Bannon maintained that he could be even more powerful outside the White House and by some measures he has become a more influential figure. He has returned to helm the right-wing website, Breitbart, and is working to create an influential political network to back candidates who fit the nationalist-populist vision of conservative politics that Bannon and Trump have championed.
But as the 2018 midterms approach, Bannon's access, influence and power are now all in question after his comments to journalist Michael Wolff in the forthcoming book "Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House" hit perhaps too close to home for the President.
In excerpts published Wednesday by The Guardian, Bannon is quoted criticizing Kushner, Manafort and Donald Trump Jr.'s decision to take a meeting with a Russian lawyer the President's son believed would bring him incriminating information on Clinton from the Russian government.
"The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor -- with no lawyers. They didn't have any lawyers," Bannon told Wolff. "Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it's all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately."
Sanders said Wednesday during the daily briefing that Trump was "furious" and "disgusted" by Bannon's comments and called accusations that Trump Jr.'s conduct was treasonous "a ridiculous accusation."
"Going after the President's son and in an absolutely outrageous and unprecedented way is probably not the best way to curry favor with anybody," she said.
Alabama race

Steve Bannon celebrates Moore's win.
Trump in his statement also needled Bannon over his failed gamble in the Alabama Senate race, saying that while Bannon had "very little to do with our historic victory ... Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than 30 years by Republicans."
Bannon backed the eventual Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore in the GOP primary -- while Trump initially backed the incumbent Sen. Luther Strange -- and continued to campaign for Moore after the nominee was accused by multiple women of sexual assault and sexual misconduct with teenage girls.

weather = tb("""A brutal winter storm descended upon the East Coast on Wednesday, bringing snow to Florida and Georgia along 
with ominous forecasts of bone-chilling temperatures and pummeling snow expected to follow across the eastern United 
States.The powerful storm prompted dire warnings from meteorologists and government officials alike, as authorities shut 
down schools, grounded flights and closed roadways throughout the Southeast. Forecasts called for the storm to become a 
“bomb cyclone” because its pressure will drop so quickly, causing it to intensify at explosive rates.Snow and freezing 
rain coating parts of the Southeast on Wednesday are only expected to be the beginning. The storm is forecast to travel 
up the coast like a snowbird in the spring, bringing snow to the Mid-Atlantic and then potential blizzard conditions in 
New England on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. After that’s done, forecasters warn, a painful cold
will follow. “Bitter cold and dangerous wind chills to persist into the weekend,” the National Weather Service said in a
warning Wednesday morning. The storm has already caused issues for travelers, halting scores of flights. Even before the
forecast snow arrived in the Northeast, airlines had canceled more than 1,700 flights on Thursday, most of them through 
the three New York-area airports as well as Boston. Airlines bracing for the weather had begun issuing waivers for 
travelers heading through essentially the entire East Coast, allowing people to change their flights without any fees.
As the storm began to grind across the East Coast, it brought wintry weather to unusual places. Snow fell Wednesday on
Tallahassee, Florida’s capital, and stretched across the border into Georgia. The Raleigh, N.C., office of the National
Weather Service reported that the temperature there dropped to 9 degrees on Wednesday morning, tying a record low set on
the same date in 1887.""")
